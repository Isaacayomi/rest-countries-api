## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the REST Countries Explorer locally on your machine.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Isaacayomi/rest-countries-api.git
    cd rest-countries-api
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    Install the necessary packages using npm:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    Alternatively, if you prefer Yarn:

    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Start the Development Server**:
    Launch the application in development mode:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will typically be available at `http://localhost:5173/` (or another port if 5173 is in use).

### Environment Variables

This project uses a public API and does not require any specific environment variables for basic operation. All API endpoints are hardcoded in `src/constant.ts`.

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

Once the application is running, you can interact with it through your web browser:

1.  **Browse Countries**: The homepage `/` displays a grid of country cards. Each card shows the country's flag, name, population, region, and capital.

2.  **Search for a Country**: Use the search input field at the top of the homepage to type in a country name. The list will dynamically update to show matching results. For example, typing "United" will show "United States", "United Kingdom", etc.

3.  **Filter by Region**: Utilize the "Filter by region" dropdown to narrow down the list of countries based on their continent. Select a region like "Africa" or "Europe" to see only countries from that region.

4.  **View Country Details**: Click on any country card to navigate to its dedicated details page. This page provides more in-depth information about the selected country, including its native name, sub-region, top-level domain, currencies, and spoken languages.

5.  **Go Back**: On the country details page, click the "Back" button to return to the previous view (either the main list or your last filtered/searched result).

6.  **Toggle Theme**: In the header, click the "Dark Mode" (or "Light Mode") button to instantly switch the application's visual theme between a bright, accessible light mode and a sleek, eye-friendly dark mode.
